# Mess Management System
This project offers two types of mess management:

Meal Management – Tracks daily meal consumption and expenses.
Expense Management – Manages individual and shared expenses within the mess.
We provide Google Sheets links that are manually created to help mess members track their transactions. Each member can view their personal financial records conveniently through these sheets.
